# Java Italia

A simple Java Web Application built using JSP and Bootstrap Italia UI KIT

## Description
The purpose is to implement a java web application that uses the [Bootstrap Italia Library](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/) as UI presentation layer. Bootstrap Italia was born as a library for the creation of Italian Public Administration Websites; the idea behind my project is to extend it to be able to reuse within more complex software such as information systems and in general web applications.
